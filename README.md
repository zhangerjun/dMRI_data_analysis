# Mini-Project 5: Evaluation of Neonatal Brain Tissue Development Using Diffusion MRI

Team: Kylie Xu*, Sara Hernandez*, and Erjun Zhang (Mentor)

This mini-project was  completed by Kylie Xu and Sara Hernandez and EJ Zhang (mentor), at NeuroPoly in University De Montreal (POLY) and Magic lab in TransMedTech Institute in CHU Sainte Justine Hospital in summer 2023 (from June 02, 2023 to August 15, 2023). It is part of the project *An Introduction to Python-based MRI Data Analysis*. (* Contributed equally in this project).

## Introduction
Preterm infants are at a higher risk of developing neurological conditions. Diffusion weighted MRI (dMRI) is a type of magnetic resonance imaging based on the measurable Brownian motion of water to create contrast in the MRI image. As a noninvasive imaging method, it is useful image method to help researchers and medical workers to understanding brain tissue growth.

As my knowledge, little Python resources exist for beginners to access diffusivity in brain tissues. Thus, we developed this project to use Python code to analysis (evaluation) brain tissue development, which could be interested by dMRI reserachers. Students can also use it as tutorial for excerise. 

## Goal and Hypothesis
### Goal
* Learn Python coding;
* Write DTI reconstruction code with Python;
* UNderstanding the brain tissue development in infants;
* Democratize the knowledge
### Hypothesis
Baby development could be characterized by a difference in diffusion MRI (DTI metrics).

We expected to see:
* Brain fibers in neonatal will mature over time and increase in anisotropic diffusion (FA value);
* AD, RD and MD metrics will decrease with gestational age.

## Methods

### Dataset
In this project, we created a cohort of diffusion MRI data, which consists of $45$ infant data from [dHCP dataset 2](http://www.developingconnectome.org/data-release/second-data-release/). The ages of them were all between $34$ weeks (GA) and $42$ weeks (GA) and $5$ infants in each week. The final infant cohort can be found in [here](./data/Baby_sublist_45.xlsx).

Steps:

1. DTI reconstruction code writing based on DIPY;
2. Use DrawEM to segment each brain and get brain tissue segmentation files;
3. Extract averaged diffusion metric values in each brain in each ROIs;
4. Plot curves showing diffusion metric changes along infant ages. 

## Results

## Reproducibility
### Dependencies
All the experiments can be completed online using either Windows, Mac or Linux computer.
* [Python 3](https://dti-tk.sourceforge.net/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Main.HomePage), [Google colab notebooks](https://colab.research.google.com/) (or [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/))

* [DIPY](https://dipy.org/): nifti file loader and saver;
* Matplotlib, ipython widgets: data visualization;
* Useful tools: [ITK-SNAP](http://www.itksnap.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php) for viewing nifti files locally, fsl-bet for creating human brain masks.

## Conclusion
We successfully used dMRI data and Python to evaluate neonatal brain tissue development; The results showed that 1) Younger babies have higher brain diffusivity compared to older babies; 2) Older babies have higher anisotropic diffusion characterized by an increase in myelination.

In future, we will use large dataset to predict brain tissue development in more ROIs. Image processing steps will also be used to let the results more reliable and precise.
